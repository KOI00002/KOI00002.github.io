            <p>This webpage is relative to the hands-on assignment of Module 4. <br> I like the things I am learning on this module, even though it gets on my nerves sometimes. <br> </p>
            <p> This week is my birthday week. I am really excited, as I think birthdays are important for one.</p>
            <p> I read on the weather news that we might be getting snow this week. That is also nice!!!</p>
